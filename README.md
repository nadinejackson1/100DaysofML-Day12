### 100DaysofML - Day12

# Decision Trees & Random Forests

On Day 12 of the 100 Days of ML journey, I explored decision trees and random forests, two powerful machine learning algorithms. Implemented a decision tree classifier on the Iris dataset, visualized the results with sklearn's plot_tree function, and performed a unit test to ensure the functionality of the classifiers.

### Project Overview

- Import necessary libraries and load the Iris dataset
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Create and train a decision tree classifier
- Create and train a random forest classifier
- Visualize the decision tree to understand its structure
- Make predictions and evaluate the performance of both classifiers
- Perform unit testing to verify the functionality of the classifiers

### Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- Import libraries and load the dataset
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Create and train decision tree and random forest classifiers
- Visualize the decision tree
- Make predictions and evaluate classifier performance
- Perform unit testing to ensure classifier functionality

### Requirements

    Python 3.x
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    scikit-learn

### Usage

To run the project, open the notebook file in a Jupyter environment or execute the Python script in your terminal. Please note that the HTML representation of the decision tree visualization may not render properly on GitHub. To view the visualization, run the notebook in a local Jupyter environment or use nbviewer.org to render the notebook.
